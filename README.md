## Module 18 Challenge

This challenge was designed for us to be able to build an API for a social networking 
site where people could create a user, share/delete thoughts and add/delete friends.

From the command line we can start the server and make requests from Insomnia to
test the routes, a demonstration of the functionality can be found here:
